Token Security.</ins>&nbsp; TALEN Tokens may be subject to expropriation and or/theft.&nbsp; Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the TALEN Distribution Contract or the TALEN Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.&nbsp; Furthermore, because the Ethereum platform rests on open source software and TALEN Tokens are based on open source software, there is the risk that Ethereum smart contracts may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the TALEN Tokens or result in the loss of Buyer&rsquo;s TALEN Tokens, the loss of Buyer&rsquo;s ability to access or control Buyer&rsquo;s TALEN Tokens, or the loss of ETH in Buyer&rsquo;s account.&nbsp; In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and holders of TALEN Tokens are not guaranteed any remedy, refund, or compensation.</p>

    <p><ins>13.7. Access to Private Keys</ins>.&nbsp; TALEN Tokens purchased by Buyer may be held by Buyer in Buyer&rsquo;s digital wallet or vault, which requires a private key, or a combination of private keys, for access.&nbsp; Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with Buyer&rsquo;s digital wallet or vault storing TALEN Tokens will result in loss of such TALEN Tokens, access to Buyer&rsquo;s TALEN Token balance and/or any initial balances in blockchains created by third parties.&nbsp; Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault service Buyer uses, may be able to misappropriate Buyer&rsquo;s TALEN Tokens.&nbsp; Company is not responsible for any such losses.</p>

    <p><ins>13.8. New Technology.</ins>&nbsp; The Project and all of the matters set forth in the White Paper are new and untested.&nbsp; The Project might not be capable of completion, implementation, or adoption.&nbsp; It is possible that no blockchain utilizing the Project will ever be launched and there may never be an operational platform.&nbsp; Even if the Project is completed, implemented, and adopted, it might not function as intended, and any tokens associated with a blockchain adopting the Project may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable.&nbsp; Also, technology is changing rapidly, so the TALEN Tokens and the Project may become outdated.</p>

    <p><ins>13.9. Reliance on Third-Parties</ins>.&nbsp; Even if completed, the Project will rely, in whole or partly, on third parties to adopt and implement it and to continue to develop, supply, and otherwise support it.&nbsp; There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will complete their work, properly carry out their obligations, or otherwise meet anyone&rsquo;s needs, all of which might have a material adverse effect on the Project.</p>

    <p><ins>13.10. Failure to Map a Public Key to Buyer&rsquo;s Account.</ins>&nbsp; Failure of Buyer to map a public key to Buyer&rsquo;s account may result in third parties being unable to recognize Buyer&rsquo;s TALEN Token balance on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

    <p><ins>13.11. Exchange &amp; Counterparty Risks</ins>.&nbsp; If Buyer sends ETH to the TALEN Distribution Contract from an exchange or an account that Buyer does not control, pursuant to the TALEN Distribution Contract, TALEN Tokens will be allocated to the account that has sent ETH; therefore, Buyer may never receive or be able to recover Buyer&rsquo;s TALEN Tokens.&nbsp; Furthermore, if Buyer chooses to maintain or hold TALEN Tokens through a cryptocurrency exchange or other third party, Buyer&rsquo;s TALEN Tokens may be stolen or lost.&nbsp; In addition, third parties may not recognize Buyer&rsquo;s claim to any derivative tokens if and when launched by third parties according to the distribution rules set in the Project.&nbsp; By using the TALEN Distribution Contract and/or by purchasing TALEN Tokens, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer sends ETH to the TALEN Distribution Contract through an exchange account and/or holds TALEN Tokens on a cryptocurrency exchange or with another third party at Buyer&rsquo;s own and sole risk.</p>

    <p><ins>13.12. Changes to the Project</ins>.&nbsp; The Project is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time.&nbsp; Although Company intends for the Project to have the features and specifications set forth in the White Paper, Company may make changes to such features and specifications for various reasons, any of which may mean that the Talenthon Platforms does not meet Buyer&rsquo;s expectations.</p>

    <p><ins>13.13. Project Completion</ins>.&nbsp; The development of the Project may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects, or departure of key personnel.</p>

    <p><ins>13.14. Lack of Interest</ins>.&nbsp; Even if the Project is finished, launched, and adopted, the ongoing success of the Project relies on the interest and participation of third parties.&nbsp; There can be no assurance or guarantee that there will be sufficient interest or participation in the Project.</p>

    <p><ins>13.15. Uncertain Regulatory Framework</ins>.&nbsp; The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets, and blockchain technology is unclear, unsettled, and rapidly changing in many jurisdictions.&nbsp; It is difficult to predict when, how, or whether at all governmental authorities will regulate such technologies.&nbsp; It is, likewise, difficult to predict when, how, or whether at all any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations, and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology, and its applications.&nbsp; Such changes could negatively impact TALEN Tokens in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that TALEN Tokens are regulated financial instruments that require registration.&nbsp; Company may cease the distribution of TALEN Tokens, the development of the Project, or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so.</p>

    <p><ins>13.16. Risk of Government Action</ins>.&nbsp; The industry in which Company operates is new and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions.&nbsp; There is always a possibility that governmental authorities will examine the operations of Company and/or pursue enforcement actions against Company.&nbsp; Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting Company in particular.&nbsp; Although Company is undertaking maximum efforts to comply with all existing regulations, due to multiple uncertainties and frequent changes in the rapidly evolving market of cryptographic tokens, digital assets, and blockchain technology, Company still may become subject to judgments, settlements, fines, or penalties, or may have to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Company&rsquo;s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the TALEN Tokens and/or the development of the Project.</p>

    <p><ins>13.17. Other Unanticipated Risks</ins>. In addition to the risks set forth here, there are other risks that the Talenthon team cannot anticipate. Risks may further materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the risks set forth here.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><ins>14.4. Release.&nbsp;</ins> To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Buyer releases Company from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between Buyer and the acts or omissions of third parties.</p>

    <p><ins>14.5. Indemnification.</ins></p>

    <p>(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless and reimburse Company from and against any and all actions, proceedings, claims, damages, demands, and actions, including without limitation fees and expenses of legal counsel, incurred by Company arising from or relating to:&nbsp; (i) Buyer&rsquo;s purchase or use of TALEN Tokens; (ii) Buyer&rsquo;s responsibilities or obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Buyer&rsquo;s breach of or violation of this Agreement; (iv) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Buyer; (v) Buyer&rsquo;s violation of any rights of any other person or entity; and/or (vi) any act or omission of Buyer that is negligent, unlawful, or constitutes willful misconduct.</p>

    <p>(b) Company reserves the right to exercise sole control over the defense, at Buyer&rsquo;s expense, of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section 14.5.&nbsp; This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between Buyer and Company.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p>

    <p><ins>15.1. Binding Arbitration.</ins> Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, &quot;Disputes&quot;) in which either Party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and the Company (i) waive your and the Company&rsquo;s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement resolved in a court, and (ii) waive your and the Company&rsquo;s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and the Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>

    <p><ins>15.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</ins>. Any Dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement is personal to you and the Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>

    <p><ins>15.3. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</ins>. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to the Company shall be sent by email to the Company at info@talenthon.io. Notice to Buyer shall be by email to the email address Buyer provides to Company. Buyer&rsquo;s notice must include (i) Buyer&rsquo;s name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (iii) the specific relief that Buyer is seeking. If Buyer and the Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable Party, then either Buyer or the Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 15, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 15.1, file a claim in court.</p>

    <p><ins>15.4. Process</ins>. Any Dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding their existence or validity, where the Parties fail to resolve it informally in accordance with 15.3, shall be referred to and finally resolved in the Arbitration Court of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Estonia in Tallinn in accordance with the Rules of the Arbitration Court.</p>

    <p><ins>15.5. Authority of Arbitrator.</ins> As limited by this Agreement and SIAC Rules, the arbitrator will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by this Agreement. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual&rsquo;s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>16. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE</strong></p>
