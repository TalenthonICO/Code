			<h4>What is the Talenthon affiliate program?</h4>
				<br>
				Talenthon is introducing a new way to get involved and earn Talent Coins with us! Even those who don’t wish to take
				part in our ICO can still earn tokens by helping us to spread the news about Talenthon ICO!
				<br><br>Talenthon will compensate participants in the affiliate program for every qualified referral.
				<br><br>A “qualified referral” is a new member that both:

				<ul>
					<li>Signs up with Talenthon during the ICO period (March 15th through June 15th of 2018) through the
						personalized referral link
					</li>
					<li>Completes a purchase during the ICO period (March 15th through June 15th of 2018) through the
						personalized referral link
					</li>
				</ul>

				<br>
				<h4>How does it work?</h4>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>You can find your personalized referral link in your account on our website (<a target="_blank" href="/">talenthon.io</a>).
					</li>
					<li>Send your personalized referral link to a friend so you can receive credit for the account they create and
						the first purchase they complete.
					</li>
					<li>After the new user registers and completes a purchase through your personalized referral link, you will
						receive 10% of the Talent Coins of their first purchase.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<br>
				<h4>Details:</h4>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Talent Coins earned from the Talenthon affiliate program will be sent to eligible affiliates within a week
						after the end of ICO.
					</li>
					<li>While there is no limit to the number of referrals you can complete, we do reserve the right to adjust or
						change the affiliate program rules.
					</li>
					<li>10% of the first purchase by referrals is eligible for compensation, not any purchases after this.</li>
					<li>The referral must register and complete their first purchase through your personalized referral link to
						receive your Talent Coins reward.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<br>
				<h4>Restrictions:</h4>
				<br>
				The following activities will disqualify a participant in the Talenthon affiliate program from earning Talent Coins:
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Self-referral and fraud</li>
					<li>Posting the personalized referral link on any Talenthon merchant’s social or forum page</li>
					<li>Keyword bidding for the purpose of generating traffic to pages with your referral link</li>
				</ul>

				<br>If a participant is found to have participated in any of these activities, their referral tokens will not be disbursed.
